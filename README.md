# Structured-Self-Attentive-Sentence-Embedding
An open-source implementation of the paper ``A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding'' published by IBM and MILA. 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130

#### Requirments
PyTorch: http://pytorch.org/

spaCy: https://spacy.io/

Please refer to https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/snli for the information about obtaining GloVe model (in PyTorch model format .pt). Typically, the model should be a tuple (dict, torch.FloatTensor, int), where the first element (dict) is a mapping from word to its index, the third element (int) is the dimension of the word embeddings, and the second element (torch.FloatTensor) with the size of word_count * dim refers to the word embeddings.

#### Usage

Tokenization
```bash
python tokenizer-yelp.py --input [Yelp dataset] --output [output path, will be a json file] --dict [output dictionary path, will be a json file]
```

Training Model
```bash
python train.py \
--emsize [word embedding size default 300] \
--nhid [hidden layer size, default 300] \
--nlayers [hidden layer numbers in Bi-LSTM, default 2] \
--attention-unit [attention unit number, d_a in the paper, default 350] \
--attention-hops [hop number, r in the paper, default 1] \
--dropout [dropout ratio, default 0.5] \
--nfc [hidden layer size for MLP in the classifier, default 512] \
--lr [learning rate, default 0.001] \
--epochs [epoch number for training, default 40] \
--seed [initial seed for reproduction, default 1111] \
--log-interval [the interval for reporting training loss, default 200] \
--batch-size [size of a batch in training procedure, default 32] \
--optimizer [type of the optimizer, default Adam] \
--penalization-coeff [coefficient of the Frobenius Norm penalization term, default 1.0] \
--class-number [number of class for the last step of classification] \
--save [path to save model] \
--dictionary [location of the dictionary generated by the tokenizer] \
--word-vector [location of the initial word vector, e.g. GloVe, should be a torch .pt model] \
--train-data [location of training data, should be in the same format with tokenized productions] \
--val-data [development set] \
--test-data [location of testing dataset] \
--cuda [whether using GPU for training, remove this when using CPU] 
```

#### Differences between the paper and our implementation
1. For faster Python based tokenization, we used spaCy instead of Stanford Tokenizer (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.shtml)

2. For faster performance, we manually crop the comments in Yelp to a max length of 500.
